# Auto-Parsing Step Responses

Short project description here (2 sentences)

## Instructions

- Make sure your data file is included in the same folder as the rest of the python files.
- Run main.py and follow prompts to input filenames and answer questions about your data.
- Make sure that when you input file name, first only include the name (ie for data.csv, type 'data' only), then type the data type (ie '.csv').
- If you follow all prompts, a graph of the data with the generated function will be included, and the step response will be printed.
- Included are some example data files that could be run.

## File List

Create a list of all of the files in your repository with one sentence descriptions 

- ArduinoTempCollectionProgram.ino contains a program that can be run on an arduino microprocessor to collect temperature data.
- FirstOrderFunctions.py contains all functions related to the parsing of data, graphing of data, and curve-fitting of data for the first order step response.
