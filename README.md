# Auto-Parsing Step Responses

Short project description here

## Instructions

- Make sure your data file is included in the same folder as the rest of the python files.
- Run main.py and follow prompts to input filenames and answer questions about your data
- Make sure that when you input file name, first only include the name (ie for data.csv, type 'data' only), then type the data type (ie '.csv').
- If you follow all prompts, a graph of the data with the generated function will be included, and the step response will be printed.
- Included are some example data files that could be run.
